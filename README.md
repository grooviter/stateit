**StateIT** creates resources and keep their state so it can keep track of them. Thanks to the stored state, **StateIT** knows what resources have been applied so far, what resources should be removed...etc. **StateIT** is a tool inspired by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

**IMPORTANT!**: StateIT is still in alpha state so it is not ready for production use yet.
