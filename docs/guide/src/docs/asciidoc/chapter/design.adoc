- Plan file is **parsed**
- Each resource found in plan has its **properties resolved** including their **dependencies** with other resources
- Once resources are build and populated, all of them are **validated**
- If the process goal was only to validate the plan, the process ends showing the result of the validation
- Anyway regardless of the goal if the plan is not valid the process ends there
- If the goal of the process is other than validation resources are applied or destroyed and then the process ends
