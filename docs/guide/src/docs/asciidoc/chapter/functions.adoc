== Functions

Although StateIT tries to be very concise, however there are a set of utility functions available in every plan that will help
to reduce even more the code of the plan.

=== Date

Date functions help to create dates for different tasks (e.g. generate a file name with the current date):

==== now()

This function converts a given date to a string using the ISO-8601 ("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ")

[source, groovy]
.now(pattern)
----
directory('todays-backup') {
  path  = "/backups/${now()}" <1>
}
----

<1> path will become **/backups/2022-12-31'T'10:00:00Z**

==== now(pattern)

This function converts a given date to a string following the pattern passed as an argument.

[source, groovy]
.now(pattern)
----
directory('todays-backup') {
  path  = "/backups/${now('yyyy-MM-dd')}" <1>
}
----

<1> path will become **/backups/2022-12-31**
