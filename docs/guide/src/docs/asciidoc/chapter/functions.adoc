== Functions

Although StateIT tries to be very concise, however there are a set of utility functions available in every plan that will help
to reduce even more the code of the plan.

=== Date

Date functions help to create dates for different tasks (e.g. generate a file name with the current date):

==== now()

TODO

==== now(pattern)

TODO

[source, groovy]
.now(pattern)
----
directory('todays-backup') {
  path  = "/backups/${now('yyyy-MM-dd')}"
}
